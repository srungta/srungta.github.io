**DISCLAIMER:**  
**This is a long-ish post as it also covers some aspects of docker networking and docker compose**  

While using the cli to get these values is handy, getting these metrics one by one, or getting them for a number of machines, or for a cluster is quite annoying. you will usually find some or the other visualization software to see these values as graphs. These tools also help us see time based trends.  
We will use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for this post, which is free and has redis connectors available.
Also **Grafana** has Docker images available. ðŸ˜Š So we will use that.


#### Get the Grafana image 
Lets first pull the Grafana image from the public docker registry.  
{%- highlight powershell -%}
docker pull grafana/grafana
{%- endhighlight -%}

You can find more about different docker images for Grafana [on their official site](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/docker/)

#### Run the Grafana image 
Run an instance of grafana using this command.
{%- highlight powershell -%}
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
{%- endhighlight -%}
Once the container starts, go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the grafana dashboard.
The default username and password is `admin`.

#### Add the Redis connector plugin
Grafana does not ship with a Redis connector by default. However their is a community plugin that is useful. [More details on the official site](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/redis-datasource/)
The plugin can be installed by passing an argument to the `docker run` command.
The grafana image exposes a build argument called `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS` which can be used to install the plugin at runtime.
The below plugin does it.
{%- highlight powershell -%}
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name grafana -e "GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=redis-datasource" grafana/grafana
{%- endhighlight -%}

#### Validate the Redis connector is present
Go to [http://localhost:3000/datasources](http://localhost:3000/datasources).

You should see a `Add data source` button like below.
![Grafana add data source](/assets/images/redis/grafana-add-data-source.png)

Search for `redis` in the search bar
![Grafana search Redis](/assets/images/redis/grafana-redis-data-source.png)

You should see a connector like shown in the image above.

#### A short note on docker networking
Before we connect to our redis instance, a short note on how docker networks work.
Docker containers are very isolated from their hosts, unless you configure them to behave differently.

So if you just write `docker run -d grafana/grafana` instead of `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana`, you wont be able to see the grafana UI, even though inside the container grafana ui code is still running.
When we specify `-p` or `--port` parameter, it tell docker to map the container port number to the host port number.
That way, when we say `-p 3000:3000`, dockers maps port 3000 of host system (your computer) to the port `3000` of the container. So when you open the [http://locahost:3000](http://locahost:3000) link in the browser, the request is routed to the container's port `3000` and you get the response.

#### Connecting redis instance to grafana
Open [http://localhost:3000/datasources](http://localhost:3000/datasources) and search for redis again.
Select the redis connector and fill in `http://localhost:6379` (our redis instance's port) in the address field and click `Save & Test`.
![Grafana Redis localhost](/assets/images/redis/grafana-redis-localhost.png)

Lets understand the error by analyzing the sequence of events.
- Grafana code is running inside the container.
- You map the container port to host port 3000 so that you can see the UI.
- In the connector form, you enter `http://localhost:6379` as your redis address.
- The grafana code inside the container get a message that redis is located at `http://localhost:6379`.
- Grafana code inside the container tries to connect to redis on port `6379` in its localhost (inside the container , not on your system)
- Grafana code does not find a redis instance on its own local 6379 port and gives the error.

This means that even if you exposed your redis instance's port to your host machine using 
`docker run --rm -p 6379:6379/TCP --name test-redis-instance redis`, it still wont work. I tried. It didn't.

I was also a bit confused at this point.
After reading the [docker networking tutorial here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/) and [explanation of bridge networks here](https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-standalone/), here is a way to do it.


#### Connecting redis instance to grafana [The hard way]
So we first have to locate the redis instance from the viewpoint of the grafana container.
Since redis is not running inside the grafana container, it means both containers should be connected by some network.
By default standalone containers connect to a docker network called `bridge`. This network acts as a liaison between the host and docker containers. (Helps move traffic, forward request, return data etc.). We just need to find the IP of the redis instance in the `bridge` network.
To do that, open another powershell window and run 
{%- highlight powershell -%}
docker network inspect bridge
{%- endhighlight -%}
This prints a JSON.
Look for a section called `Containers`.
```json
...
"Containers": {
    "71df1fb060baeb221cb01b78e3c60717934fa...": {
        "Name": "test-redis-instance",
        "EndpointID": "cefcf5c80fed007b...",
        "MacAddress": "....",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.3/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    },
    "d22e95f9ee297e66839d93b9e41afdd367169...": {
        "Name": "grafana",
        "EndpointID": "e56d45454e56562a...",
        "MacAddress": "....",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.4/16",
        "IPv6Address": ""
    }
}
...
```
Copy the `IPv4Address` for the `test-redis-instance` container. In my case it is `172.17.0.3`.
Now in the grafana UI, use this IP along with the port 6379, as the address of the redis instance `172.17.0.3:6379`

#### Connecting redis instance to grafana [The easy way]
Finding the IP addresses like this is annoying and error prone.
Docker has something called [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) that lets use write multi container docker applications nicely.
To do this create a folder named `floozy` (this name does not matter)
inside the folder create four files 
```bash
|- floozy
    |--- docker-compose.yml
    |--- redis.DockerFile
    |--- grafana.DockerFile
    |--- .env
```

| File               | Usage                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| docker-compose.yml | Starts up multiple containers and connects them |
| redis.DockerFile   | Describes how to build the redis container      |
| grafana.DockerFile | Describes how to build the grafana container    |
| .env               | Sets some environment variables                 |

> **DockerFile** is used to create custom images based on some base images. [Read more about Dockerfile on their official site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

#### redis.DockerFile
Since we did not do any customization on top of redis image, this file can just have this
{%- highlight docker -%}
FROM redis
{%- endhighlight -%}
This is basically saying use the default redis image.

#### grafana.DockerFile
Remember we had to install the redis connector plugin on the base grafana image. Now we can do it in the DockerFile

```docker
# Take the base grafana image
FROM grafana/grafana:latest 
# Set the GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS environment variable so that the plugin is installed
ENV GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=redis-datasource
```

#### docker-compose.yml
```yaml
# Use version 2 of the compose formal
version: '2'
# Define custom network.
# So that we can clearly analyse what is going on.
# Also so that our containers are unaffected by other things
networks:
    # Alias for the network
    cache:
        # Explicitly specifying the name of the network
        name: cache

# This is the list of services/containers to run
services:
    # This is the definition for our redis container
    redis-instance:
        # This part tells docker how to build the redis container
        build: 
            # This is the directory
            # where docker will look 
            # for the dockerfile specified below
            context: .
            # The docker file that has the definition for the image
            dockerfile: redis.DockerFile
        # Add this container to the cache network created above
        networks:
            - cache
    
    # This is the definition for our grafana container
    grafana-ui:
        # Map the 3000 port to 
        # the host system so that 
        # you can view the UI in the browser
        ports: 
            - "3000:3000"
        # Same as redis
        build: 
            context: .
            dockerfile: grafana.DockerFile
        # Same as redis
        networks:
            - cache
```

#### .env
This sets the environment variables.
By default when you use docker compose to create containers, it prefixes the names of the containers with the name of the folder. I find that annoying at times. you can set an environment variable called `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` which will be used as prefix.
In .env file.
```env
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=understanding-redis
```

When all this is done, navigate to `floozy` folder and run 
```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
```
You will see a lot of logs similar to the ones you see when downloading a new docker image.
This is docker compose building the docker files and creating containers for you.
You should see something like below on the cli
```bash
- Network cache                                   Created
- Container understanding-redis_redis-instance_1  Started
- Container understanding-redis_grafana-ui_1     Started

```
Run `docker ps` to see the containers.

#### But why all this setup?
The advantage of docker compose is that it lets containers locate and refer to each other by their names/aliases instead of IP addresses.
So now instead of finding the IP of redis instance the hard way, you can just say `redis-instance` as the host name.

In the grafana UI at [http://localhost:3000/datasources](http://localhost:3000/datasources), replace the ip address with just `redis-instance:6379`
![Grafana redis with service name](/assets/images/redis/grafana-redis-instance.png)
The connection succeeds.

From now on we will try to use docker compose wherever possible, when we need communication between containers.
