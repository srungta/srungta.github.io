#### Start Right - UI - Set up lint

### Introduction

Linting is essentially enforcing common code styles.

It is a crucial step in UI development that ensures your code adheres to a consistent style and avoids common errors. By catching issues early in the development process, linting helps maintain high-quality code and reduces the likelihood of bugs.

#### Benefits of Linting:

- **Improved Code Consistency**: Enforces a uniform coding style across the team, making the codebase easier to read and maintain.

- **Error Prevention**: Detects potential issues such as syntax errors, unused variables, or deprecated APIs before they cause runtime problems.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Simplifies code reviews by reducing subjective discussions about style and formatting. Discussions about space versus tabs is a waste of time. Decide early and stick to it.
- **Time Savings**: Automates the process of identifying and fixing common coding mistakes, allowing developers to focus on building features.
- **Scalability**: Ensures that as the team grows, the codebase remains clean and manageable. <span style="color:orange">**üëà Cannot stress this enough!**</span>
